I welcome discussions and questions about data processing, visualization, and, if you want, steam turbines and other major power plant equipment (boilers, gas turbines, generators, etc.). \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I am a steam turbine engineer and have a background in mechanical engineering. I work in Korea, and my current job is to provide technical support for operational issues in power plants. \n\nI enjoy analyzing data, which is why I started using R, a statistical language, and am now very interested in data visualization. \nMost of the data I work with is time series data from power plants, and my main job is to analyze it to find the root cause of issues and suggest solutions, so it's necessary to me to be able to visualize what I need in order to deliver intuitive messages to customers.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.329","editor":"source","theme":"litera","title":"Sean Ahn","image":"profile.jpg","about":{"template":"trestles","image-width":"10em","image-shape":"round","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/junho-ahn-engineer"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
