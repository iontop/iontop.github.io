### Hello! Nice to meet you!

I have been a performance engineer for steam turbines for the past 16 years at [DoosanEnerbility](https://www.doosanenerbility.com/en) If you want to know more about my background as an engineer, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junho-ahn-engineer/). I welcome discussions and questions about data processing, visualization, and, if you want, steam turbines and other major power plant equipment (boilers, gas turbines, generators, etc.). 

My last name is pronounced JU-NO(two-syllables, pronounce is similar as Romann goddess, but I'm totally male.) and write "JUN HO".
So you guys just call me 'Sean' as my English name. It's much easier than native Korean pronounce.

As I mentioned earlier, I am a steam turbine engineer and have a background in mechanical engineering. I work in Korea, and my current job is to provide technical support for operational issues in power plants. 

I enjoy analyzing data, which is why I started using R, a statistical language, and am now very interested in data visualization. 
Most of the data I work with is time series data from power plants, and my main job is to analyze it to find the root cause of issues and suggest solutions, so it's necessary to me to be able to visualize what I need in order to deliver intuitive messages to customers.
