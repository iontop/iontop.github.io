### Hello! Nice to meet you!

I have been a performance engineer for steam turbines for the past 16 years, and now I am the team leader of a team that provides technical support to customers operating power plants. (If you want to know more about my background as an engineer, please visit my LinkedIn profile.)

I enjoy site troubleshooting and analyzing operational data, which is why I started using R, a statistical language, and am now very interested in data visualization. I welcome discussions and questions about data processing, visualization, and, if you want, steam turbines and other major power plant equipment (boilers, gas turbines, generators, etc.).
