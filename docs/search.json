The HarEyeColor dataset is a three-dimensional table, as mentioned above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Bing what the difference was between a table and a data frame, they told me as below;\nBing’s answer: A table is a two-dimensional object that stores data in rows and columns, while a data frame is a collection of one-dimensional vectors that can have different data types and can mimic a table. A data frame is a term that comes from R, a programming language for data analysis. A data.table is a special type of data frame that has more features and faster performance.\n\n\n\nhead(HairEyeColor)\n\n, , Sex = Male\n\n       Eye\nHair    Brown Blue Hazel Green\n  Black    32   11    10     3\n  Brown    53   50    25    15\n  Red      10   10     7     7\n  Blond     3   30     5     8\n\n, , Sex = Female\n\n       Eye\nHair    Brown Blue Hazel Green\n  Black    36    9     5     2\n  Brown    66   34    29    14\n  Red      16    7     7     7\n  Blond     4   64     5     8\n\n\n\nConverting to a data frame is better for manipulating data in R.

    "text": "Visualization\nIf you were to draw a bar plot to visualize a dataset such as HairEyeColor, you would probably draw a plot like the one below.\nI’ve plotted a bar plot with men and women represented by different colors and separated by hair color using facet_wrap().\nIf we just plotted a bar plot, it would be hard to tell the exact values, so we used geom_text() to display the values above each bar. If you want to use geom_text() to display the values, be sure to write label = “the value you want to display” in aes() of ggplot().\n\ndf |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Sex, label = Freq)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.8, position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Sex, group = Sex), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c(\"right\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you want to highlight certain values in a bar graph. For example, if you want to highlight the eye colors that have the most of each in the hair color facet, the following code might be one of the appropriate answers.\nYou can also use ggplot extensions (such as gghighlight), but I only used the ggplot internal functions. The point is that we create one more column called “Chk” and fill it with different colors based on the value of “Chk”.\nThis method is fairly simple, but very useful for displaying specific values without affecting the original dataset (no transformations).\nEspecially when you have a large number of values to represent and a large number of bars, you can emphasize the message you want by representing certain values with a different color that stands out.\n\ndf |> \n  group_by(Hair) |> \n  mutate(Chk = max(Freq) == Freq) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, label = Freq, group = Sex)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Chk), color = \"white\", alpha = 0.8, position = \"dodge\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Chk, group = Sex), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.\", \n       x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c(\"right\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray80\",\"coral\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray80\", \"coral\")) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating a bar plot and adding labels, sometimes you need to include both absolute values and percentages (%).\nThis code shows what to do in such situations. There are two ways to do this, I’ve used the scales package in the code below, and I’ve commented out the other way of calculating the % value and then adding the “%” symbol. Either way is your choice.\n\ndf |> \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") |> \n  group_by(Hair) |> \n  mutate(Ratio = Freq / sum(Freq)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Hair, label = Ratio)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +\n  # geom_text(aes(label = paste(round(Ratio*100,1), \"%\"), color = Hair), vjust = -0.1) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(scales::percent(round(Ratio,3)),\"\\n\",\"(\",Freq,\")\"), color = Hair), \n            vjust = -0.2, hjust = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.\", \n       x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c(\"right\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother option is to overlay a line plot on top of a bar chart, which sometimes makes for a great visualization. Actually it’s not really necessary for this data set, but if you wanted to show changes over time, a line plot like the one below would be very helpful for readers to understand.\nI think this is an example of how ggplot is a powerful visualization tool. 👍\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you can see, when I draw a point, I draw two points for one value. This is to make it look better, so I draw one large point in white and the other smaller one in the same color as the bar. This work makes the distinction between a bar and a point clearer and helps the reader understand the trend of the line more easily.\n\n\n\ndf |> \n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Hair, label = Freq)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_point(color = \"white\", size = 4, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Hair), size = 2, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_path(aes(group = Hair, color = Hair), lty = 2, linewidth = 1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Hair), vjust = -1.0, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.\", \n       x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF POST"

Nice to meet you!\nI have been a performance engineer for steam turbines for the past 16 years at DoosanEnerbility If you want to know more about my background as an engineer, please visit my LinkedIn profile. I welcome discussions and questions about data processing, visualization, and, if you want, steam turbines and other major power plant equipment (boilers, gas turbines, generators, etc.).\nMy last name is pronounced JU-NO(two-syllables, pronounce is similar as Romann goddess, but I’m totally male.) and write “JUN HO”. So you guys just call me ‘Sean’ as my English name. It’s much easier than native Korean pronounce.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I am a steam turbine engineer and have a background in mechanical engineering. I work in Korea, and my current job is to provide technical support for operational issues in power plants.\nI enjoy analyzing data, which is why I started using R, a statistical language, and am now very interested in data visualization. Most of the data I work with is time series data from power plants, and my main job is to analyze it to find the root cause of issues and suggest solutions, so it’s necessary to me to be able to visualize what I need in order to deliver intuitive messages to customers.\nTo build this blog, I use Quarto and publish it to github. Quarto is one of my favorite publishing tool! If you haven’t tried it yet, you should give it a try."
