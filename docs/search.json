The plots for each of the 12 plants are arranged side-by-side and have the same y scale to make them easier to compare.\nThe label values on the x-axis were rotated 90 degrees to avoid overlapping letters, making it easier for readers to read the numbers.\n\nCO2 |> \n  ggplot(aes(conc, uptake, color = Plant)) +\n  geom_path(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Plant), shape = 21, fill = \"white\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Plant), nrow = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1200), breaks = seq(0,1200,400)) +\n  labs(title = \"Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"The CO2 data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the cold tolerance\",\"\\n\" ,\n                         \"of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli.\"),\n       x = \"Ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L)\",\n       y = \"Carbon dioxide uptake rates (umol/sq.m sec)\",\n       color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\nThis time, I plotted a different version of line plot. This plot is a useful way to show a specific value in a spaghetti plot with a lot of data jumbled together.\nThe package gghighlight makes it very easy to do this 👍, but I sometimes use the above method of plotting using ggplot’s layers instead of using the gghighlight package.\nThe key to plotting with ggplot’s layer method is to use the subset() function. This is a very useful tip because it allows you to highlight one or more graphs.\nBoth methods are great, so it’s a matter of preference.\n\nCO2 |> \n  ggplot(aes(conc, uptake, group = Plant, label = Plant)) +\n  # path color sets by color name then determine color in scale_color_manual()\n  geom_path(data = subset(CO2, Plant != \"Mn1\"), aes(color = \"Others\"), linewidth = 1, lty = 2) +\n  geom_path(data = subset(CO2, Plant == \"Mn1\"), aes(color = \"Mn1\"), linewidth = 1, lty = 1) +\n  # point color determines in geom_point() directly\n  geom_point(data = subset(CO2, Plant != \"Mn1\"), shape = 21, fill = \"white\", color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data = subset(CO2, Plant == \"Mn1\"), shape = 21, fill = \"white\", color = \"coral\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Others\" = \"gray80\",\"Mn1\" = \"coral\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"The CO2 data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the cold tolerance\",\"\\n\" ,\n                         \"of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli.\"),\n       x = \"Ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L)\",\n       y = \"Carbon dioxide uptake rates (umol/sq.m sec)\",\n       color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.15), # Caution!!! it is relative position ex) 0: left end ~ 1: right end\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n        legend.box.background = element_rect(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\nThis time, we want to plot the classification of plants according to their macroclassification (Mc, Mn, Qc, Qn).\nTo do this, we first create a column called category using the mutate() function and put in the values that define the major classifications of plants.\n\ndf <- \n  CO2 |> \n  mutate(category = case_when(str_detect(Plant, \"Qn\") ~ \"Qn\",\n                              str_detect(Plant, \"Qc\") ~ \"Qc\",\n                              str_detect(Plant, \"Mn\") ~ \"Mn\",\n                              str_detect(Plant, \"Mc\") ~ \"Mc\",\n                              .default = \"Unknown\"))\ndf |> head()\n\n  Plant   Type  Treatment conc uptake category\n1   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled   95   16.0       Qn\n2   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  175   30.4       Qn\n3   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  250   34.8       Qn\n4   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  350   37.2       Qn\n5   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  500   35.3       Qn\n6   Qn1 Quebec nonchilled  675   39.2       Qn\n\n\nI have colored them according to the Plant category because if we colored them according to the Plant taxonomy, they would be indistinguishable.\nThe rest of the plot is the same as the previous plot.\n\ndf |> \n  ggplot(aes(conc, uptake, color = Plant)) +\n  geom_path(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Plant), shape = 21, fill = \"white\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(category), nrow = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"The CO2 data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the cold tolerance\",\"\\n\" ,\n                         \"of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli.\"),\n       x = \"Ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L)\",\n       y = \"Carbon dioxide uptake rates (umol/sq.m sec)\",\n       color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nWhen plotting as above, it is sometimes uncomfortable to see a lot of items in the legend.\nOr, you may want to show each piece of data in a single plot.\nIn either case, the solution is to break it down into smaller plots with appropriate zones. Like the one I created earlier with the native plot() function, I can display 12 small plots in a 4X3 array as shown below, and you can see that the code has become very simple and straightforward.\n\ndf |> \n  ggplot(aes(conc, uptake, color = Plant)) +\n  geom_path(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Plant), shape = 21, fill = \"white\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(category, Plant), ncol = 4, dir = \"v\", labeller = labeller(.multi_line = FALSE)) +\n  labs(title = \"Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"The CO2 data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the cold tolerance\",\"\\n\" ,\n                         \"of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli.\"),\n       x = \"Ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L)\",\n       y = \"Carbon dioxide uptake rates (umol/sq.m sec)\",\n       color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nI’ve plotted four different line plots in this blog post, which can be broadly divided into two categories.\nLine plots are likely to look cluttered when plotted on a single plot, so it’s important to keep them as simple as possible.\n\nEND OF POST"

If you want to use geom_text() to display the values, be sure to write label = “the value you want to display” in aes() of ggplot().\n\ndf |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Sex, label = Freq)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.8, position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Sex, group = Sex), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c(\"right\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you want to highlight certain values in a bar graph. For example, if you want to highlight the eye colors that have the most of each in the hair color facet, the following code might be one of the appropriate answers.\nYou can also use ggplot extensions (such as gghighlight), but I only used the ggplot internal functions. The point is that we create one more column called “Chk” and fill it with different colors based on the value of “Chk”.\nThis method is fairly simple, but very useful for displaying specific values without affecting the original dataset (no transformations).\nEspecially when you have a large number of values to represent and a large number of bars, you can emphasize the message you want by representing certain values with a different color that stands out.\n\ndf |> \n  group_by(Hair) |> \n  mutate(Chk = max(Freq) == Freq) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, label = Freq, group = Sex)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Chk), color = \"white\", alpha = 0.8, position = \"dodge\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Chk, group = Sex), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.\", \n       x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c(\"right\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray80\",\"coral\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray80\", \"coral\")) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating a bar plot and adding labels, sometimes you need to include both absolute values and percentages (%).\nThis code shows what to do in such situations. There are two ways to do this, I’ve used the scales package in the code below, and I’ve commented out the other way of calculating the % value and then adding the “%” symbol. Either way is your choice.\n\ndf |> \n  filter(Sex == \"Male\") |> \n  group_by(Hair) |> \n  mutate(Ratio = Freq / sum(Freq)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Hair, label = Ratio)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +\n  # geom_text(aes(label = paste(round(Ratio*100,1), \"%\"), color = Hair), vjust = -0.1) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(scales::percent(round(Ratio,3)),\"\\n\",\"(\",Freq,\")\"), color = Hair), \n            vjust = -0.2, hjust = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.\", \n       x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c(\"right\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother option is to overlay a line plot on top of a bar chart, which sometimes makes for a great visualization. Actually it’s not really necessary for this data set, but if you wanted to show changes over time, a line plot like the one below would be very helpful for readers to understand.\nI think this is an example of how ggplot is a powerful visualization tool. 👍\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you can see, when I draw a point, I draw two points for one value. This is to make it look better, so I draw one large point in white and the other smaller one in the same color as the bar. This work makes the distinction between a bar and a point clearer and helps the reader understand the trend of the line more easily.\n\n\n\ndf |> \n  filter(Sex == \"Female\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Hair, label = Freq)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_point(color = \"white\", size = 4, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Hair), size = 2, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_path(aes(group = Hair, color = Hair), lty = 2, linewidth = 1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Hair), vjust = -1.0, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students\",\n       subtitle = \"Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.\", \n       x = \"Eye Color\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Hair) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF POST"

In fact, the points of the ‘waiting’ variable colored in blue could probably be combined with the points colored in purple, but for the purposes of this post, I’ll leave them unmodified.\n\ndf |> \n  mutate(waitLv = cut_number(waiting, 4)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(waiting, eruptions, color = waitLv)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I’ve made a good scatterplot. In addition, I want to add a linear trend equation.\nTo do that, I need to create a linear model with the lm() function.\nIt’s a pretty powerful 💪 R function.\nI can create a linear model using just the simple lm() function.\n\n# Calculate slope and intercept of line of best fit\nlinear <- lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data = faithful)\nlinear\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = eruptions ~ waiting, data = faithful)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)      waiting  \n   -1.87402      0.07563  \n\n\n\nlinear$coefficients[1]\n\n(Intercept) \n  -1.874016 \n\ni <- linear$coefficients[1]\n\n\nlinear$coefficients[2]\n\n   waiting \n0.07562795 \n\ns <- linear$coefficients[2]\n\n\nWe got the coefficient value as a result of lm().\nI can see that the slope of the trend line I’m plotting is 0.0756279, and the intercept islinear$coefficients[1]`.\nIt then draws a trend line on the plot with the slope and intercept values.\ngeom_abline() draws a line with specific slope and intercept values as shown below.\n\ndf |> \n  mutate(waitLv = cut_number(waiting, 4)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(waiting, eruptions, color = waitLv)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = i, slope = s)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I use geom_smooth() to represent a confidence interval (se = TRUE), I can draw a trend line at once without having to find the slope and intercept values outside.\nHowever, even with geom_smooth(), I still need to know the slope and intercept to plot the trend equations, which can be redundant.\nIt is users’ choice to use geom_smooth() or geom_abline().\n\ndf |> \n  mutate(waitLv = cut_number(waiting, 4)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(waiting, eruptions)) + # Should remove \"aes(color = waitLv)\" in ggplot()\n  geom_point(aes(color = waitLv)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm ,se = TRUE, color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.5) # BUT!! to extract equation you should using \"lm()\"\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI put equation in plot with annotate() at proper location. and title, subtitle, name of x-axis and y-axis also display with lab().\nFinally I got plot as below.\n\ndf |> \n  mutate(waitLv = cut_number(waiting, 4)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(waiting, eruptions, color = waitLv)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = i, slope = s, color = \"blue\", lty = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\",x = 50, y = 4.5, label = paste0(\"y = \", round(s,5) ,\"x +\",round(i,5))) +\n  labs(title = \"Old Faithful geyser\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser\",\"\\n\",\n                         \"in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.\"),\n       x = \"Waiting time to next eruption (min)\", y = \"Eruption time (min)\", color = \"Lv. of Wating Time\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\ngood luck! 👍\n\nEND OF POST"

    "text": "Hello! Nice to meet you!\nI have been a performance engineer for steam turbines for the past 16 years at DoosanEnerbility If you want to know more about my background as an engineer, please visit my LinkedIn profile. I welcome discussions and questions about operation data processing, visualization, and, if you want, steam turbines and other major power plant equipment (boilers, gas turbines, generators, etc.).\nThe words “steam turbine” and “performance engineer” are probably very foreign to you. If you work in a power plant or produce equipment to generate electricity, you might know them, but for most people, they are unfamiliar 😅.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I am a steam turbine engineer and have a background in mechanical engineering, based in South Korea and my current role is to provide engineering solutions to customers for power plant operational issues.\nI enjoy analyzing data, which is why I started using R, a statistical language, and am now very interested in data visualization. Most of the data I work with is time series data from power plants, and my main job is to analyze it to find the root cause of issues and suggest solutions, so it’s necessary to me to be able to visualize what I need in order to deliver intuitive messages to customers.\nTo build this blog, I use Quarto and publish it to github. Quarto is one of my favorite publishing tool! If you haven’t tried it yet, you should give it a try."
