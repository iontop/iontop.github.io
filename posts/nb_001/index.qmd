In this blog post, we'll cover how to plot a bar plot with ggplot2. Bar plots are one of the most popular graphs because they can convey meaning simply and intuitively.

## Initilize

I usually use the following code for initialization. If you don't want to remove plots and/or variables, you can skip it.

```{r}
graphics.off()
rm(list = ls())
gc()
```

```{r}
version
```

## Load Useful Library

We want to use as few packages (some might call them "libraries") as possible. If possible, I'm going to use only the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is one of the most famous packages in R programming, and it's really powerful and useful.

[sclales](https://scales.r-lib.org) is a popular package in R that helps you convert values easily. It is also compatible with ggplot, which is a great help for visualization.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

```

## Select Dataset

When I write posts in my blog, I use the built-in dataset because I don't want the reader to suffer by having to find the data from somewhere else.

The dataset I'll be using in this post is shown below `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` .

**Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students**

### Description

Distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students.

### Usage

HairEyeColor

### Format

A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 592 observations on 3 variables. The variables and their levels are as follows:

No Name Levels 1 Hair Black, Brown, Red, Blond 2 Eye Brown, Blue, Hazel, Green 3 Sex Male, Female

### Details

The Hair x Eye table comes from a survey of students at the University of Delaware reported by Snee (1974). The split by Sex was added by Friendly (1992a) for didactic purposes.

This data set is useful for illustrating various techniques for the analysis of contingency tables, such as the standard chi-squared test or, more generally, log-linear modelling, and graphical methods such as mosaic plots, sieve diagrams or association plots.

<br>

I use the `head()` function to quickly see what data is in a data set. The `HarEyeColor` dataset is a three-dimensional table, as mentioned above.

:::callout-note

When I asked Bing what the difference was between a table and a data frame, they told me as below;

Bing's answer: A table is a two-dimensional object that stores data in rows and columns, while a data frame is a collection of one-dimensional vectors that can have different data types and can mimic a table. A data frame is a term that comes from R, a programming language for data analysis. A data.table is a special type of data frame that has more features and faster performance.

```{r}
head(HairEyeColor)

```

<br>

Converting to a data frame is better for manipulating data in R. Try to convert table into data frame using `as.data.frame.table()` or `as.data.frame()` then store into the `df` variable.

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame.table(HairEyeColor)
df |> head()

```

<br>



```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, fill = Sex, label = Freq)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.8, position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(color = Sex, group = Sex), position = position_dodge(width = 1), vjust = -0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Eye Color", y = "Frequency") +
  facet_wrap(~ Hair, strip.position = c("right")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = seq(0,80,20)) +
  theme_bw()

```

<br>



```{r}

  group_by(Hair) |>

  ggplot(aes(x = Eye, y = Freq, label = Freq, group = Sex)) +
