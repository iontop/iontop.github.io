In this post we will plot a bar histogram using data from the Michelson experiment and discuss what colours should be used for colourblind people when plotting a bar histogram. The plots we will create will be visible to colourblind people, so it is important that we visualise them using colours that are easily recognisable by everyone.

## Initializing

I usually use the following code for initialization. If you don't want to remove plots and/or variables, you can skip it.

```{r}
graphics.off()
rm(list = ls())
gc()

```

```{r}
version
```

## Loading useful library

We want to use as few packages (some might call them "libraries") as possible. If possible, I'm going to use only the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is one of the most famous packages in R programming, and it's really powerful and useful.


[sclales](https://scales.r-lib.org) is a popular package in R that helps you convert values easily. It is also compatible with ggplot, which is a great help for visualization.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

```

## Select Dataset

When I write posts in my blog, I use the built-in dataset because I don't want the reader to suffer by having to find the data from somewhere else.

The dataset I'll be using in this post is shown below `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` .

**Michelson Speed of Light Data**

### Description

A classical data of Michelson (but not this one with Morley) on measurements done in 1879 on the speed of light. The data consists of five experiments, each consisting of 20 consecutive ‘runs’. The response is the speed of light measurement, suitably coded (km/sec, with 299000 subtracted).

### Usage

morley

### Format

A data frame with 100 observations on the following 3 variables.

`Expt`
The experiment number, from 1 to 5.

`Run`
The run number within each experiment.

`Speed`
Speed-of-light measurement.

### Details

The data is here viewed as a randomized block experiment with ‘experiment’ and ‘run’ as the factors. ‘run’ may also be considered a quantitative variate to account for linear (or polynomial) changes in the measurement over the course of a single experiment.


```{r}
morley |> head()

```

```{r}
class(morley)

```

```{r}
dim(morley)

```

```{r}
df1 <- morley |> group_by(Expt) |> summarise(Avg = mean(Speed))
df1

```

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg)) +
  geom_col()

```

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg, fill=as.factor(Expt))) +
  geom_col()

```


A number of color palettes have been developed with the intention of being accessible to people who are colorblind. Three of them appear below, from the [IBM Design Library](https://lospec.com/palette-list/ibm-color-blind-safe), Bang Wong, and Paul Tol respectively. Click on any of them to load it into the color palette selection tool above.

**IBM Color Blind Safe Palette**

"#648fff", "#785ef0", "#dc267f", "#fe6100", "#ffb000", "#000000", "#ffffff"

```{r}
IBMColor <- c("#648fff", "#785ef0", "#dc267f", "#fe6100", "#ffb000")
```


```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg, fill=as.factor(Expt))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = IBMColor)
```

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg, fill=as.factor(Expt))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = IBMColor) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(750, 950), breaks = seq(750, 950, 50))

```

If the purpose is to zoom, use the limit argument in the coordinate system (see [coord_cartesian()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html)).

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg, fill=as.factor(Expt))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = IBMColor) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(750, 950, 50)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(750,950))

```

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg, fill=as.factor(Expt))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =  mean(df1$Avg), lty = 3, linewidth = 1, color = "#000000") + # native R pipe operator NOT support '.Avg'  
  scale_fill_manual(values = IBMColor) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(750, 950, 50)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(750,950))

```

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(Expt, Avg, fill=as.factor(Expt), label = Avg)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =  mean(df1$Avg), lty = 3, linewidth = 1, color = "#000000") + # native R pipe operator NOT support '.Avg'  
  geom_text(vjust = 2.5, fontface = "bold", color = "white") +
  annotate("text", x = 4.5, y = 870, label = paste0("Average of Light speed is 852.5km/sec","\n","(with 299,000 subtracted)")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = IBMColor) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(750, 950, 50)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(750,950))

```

```{r}
