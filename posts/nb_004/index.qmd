## Initializing

I usually use the following code for initialization. If you don't want to remove plots and/or variables, you can skip it.

```{r}
graphics.off()
rm(list = ls())
gc()

```

```{r}
version
```

## Loading Useful Library

We want to use as few packages (some might call them "libraries") as possible. If possible, I'm going to use only the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is one of the most famous packages in R programming, and it's really powerful and useful.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tsibble)
library(gghighlight)

```

## Select Dataset

When I write posts in my blog, I use the built-in dataset because I don't want the reader to suffer by having to find the data from somewhere else.

The dataset I'll be using in this post is shown below `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` .

**Flow of the River Nile**

### Description

Measurements of the annual flow of the river Nile at Aswan (formerly Assuan), 1871–1970, in 10^8 m^3, “with apparent changepoint near 1898” (Cobb(1978), Table 1, p.249).

### Usage

Nile

### Format

A time series of length 100.

The tsibble package provides a data infrastructure for tidy temporal data with wrangling tools. Adapting the tidy data principles, tsibble is a data- and model-oriented object. In tsibble:

1. Index is a variable with inherent ordering from past to present.

2. Key is a set of variables that define observational units over time.

3. Each observation should be uniquely identified by index and key.

4. Each observational unit should be measured at a common interval, if regularly spaced.


```{r}
#coerce ts to tsibble
df <- as_tsibble(Nile)
df |> head()

```

```{r}
class(df)
```

```{r}
dim(df)
```

```{r}
colnames(df) <- c("year", "flow")
df |> head()
```

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, flow)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
df1 <- 
  df |> 
  mutate(grp = cut_number(year, 2, labels = FALSE), 
         lag = difference(flow, default = 0))
df1
```


```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(year)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = flow), fill = "midnightblue") +
  geom_area(aes(y = lag), fill = "orange")
  
```

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(year)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = flow), fill = "midnightblue") +
  geom_area(aes(y = lag), fill = "orange") +
  facet_wrap(vars(grp), ncol = 1)
```

```{r}
grp_status <- c( "1" = "First 50years", "2" = "Second 50years")
```


```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(year)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = flow), fill = "midnightblue") +
  geom_area(aes(y = lag), fill = "orange") +
  facet_wrap(vars(grp), ncol = 1, scale = "free_x", labeller = labeller(grp = grp_status))
```


```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(year)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = flow, fill = "Flow")) +
  geom_area(aes(y = lag, fill = "Lag")) +
  facet_wrap(vars(grp), ncol = 1, scale = "free_x", labeller = labeller(grp = grp_status)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Legend", values = c("Flow" = "midnightblue", "Lag" = "orange"))

```

The first 50 years of the 100-year period saw more change, while the second 50 years saw less change.

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(year)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = flow, fill = "Flow")) +
  geom_area(aes(y = lag, fill = "Lag")) +
  facet_wrap(vars(grp), ncol = 1, scale = "free_x", labeller = labeller(grp = grp_status)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Legend", values = c("Flow" = "midnightblue", "Lag" = "orange")) +
  labs(title = "Flow of the River Nile", 
       subtitle = paste0("Measurements of the annual flow of the river Nile at Aswan (formerly Assuan), 1871–1970,","\n" ,"in 10^8 m^3"),
       x = "Year", y = "Flow (10^8 cu.m)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
                     legend.box.background = element_rect(colour = "black"))
