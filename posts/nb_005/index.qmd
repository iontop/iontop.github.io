In this post, I've done a boxplot with ToothGrowth dataset. As you know, box plot is one of the most useful plot to visualize the dataset. But I don't explain what box plot. If you want to know what box plot is, you can see the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot).


## Initializing

I usually use the following code for initialization. If you don't want to remove plots and/or variables, you can skip it.

```{r}
graphics.off()
rm(list = ls())
gc()

```

```{r}
version
```

## Loading Useful Library

We want to use as few packages (some might call them "libraries") as possible. If possible, I'm going to use only the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is one of the most famous packages in R programming, and it's really powerful and useful.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Select Dataset

When I write posts in my blog, I use the built-in dataset because I don't want the reader to suffer by having to find the data from somewhere else.

The dataset I'll be using in this post is shown below `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` .

**The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs**

### Description

The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

### Usage

ToothGrowth

### Format

A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.

[,1]	len	numeric	Tooth length.   
[,2]	supp	factor	Supplement type (VC or OJ).  
[,3]	dose	numeric	Dose in milligrams/day. 

As like other posts, I check what is in dataset and how big dataset is.  

Nothing special `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

```{r}
ToothGrowth |> head()
```

```{r}
ToothGrowth |> class()
```

```{r}
ToothGrowth |> dim()
```

## Visualization

All right! First of all, dataset copied into 'df' variable to preserve original data.  

It is fine for now because I work with built-in dataset. However, I strongly recommend copy if you work with your own dataset. It will help you saving time or work done properly.

```{r}
df <- ToothGrowth
df |> head()
```

Now I make simple dotplot. it is hard to understand what data mean. but readers can notice there are distribution on something.

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len)) +
  geom_point()
```

I overlay boxplot with dotplot. it can make readers understand easily because box plot shows lots of information graphically. (e.g median, first quartile, third quartile, etc.). 

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point()
```

I colored data respectively to distinguish easily. 

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len, color = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point()
```

I replace to `geom_jitter()` because some of data is overplotting when I used `geom_point()`.  

It looks much better! `r emo::ji("+1")`  

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len, color = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, width = 0.2)
```

to make whisker on boxplot, I added `min` and `max` column with `mutate()` function. 

```{r}
df1 <- 
  df |> 
  group_by(supp) |> 
  mutate(min = min(len), max = max(len))
```

Then `goem_errorbar()` shows minimum value and maximum value as like below.  

```{r}
df1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len, color = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min, ymax = max), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, width = 0.2)

```

In fact, this boxplot is pretty good enough. To make the boxplot into a dose-dependent plot of tooth growth, I create a new variable named df2.  

```{r}
df2 <- 
  df |> 
  group_by(supp, dose) |> 
  mutate(min = min(len), max = max(len))
```

If I make the plot in the same way as before, and use the `facet_warp()` function to draw a boxplot by dose, I'll get something like this. 

```{r}
df2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len, color = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min, ymax = max), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, width = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(vars(dose))

```

All most done now. to specify what tab means, I change tab names with `labeller()` function. and I add an explanation in plot, decorate theme.

I finally got it. `r emo::ji("beer")`

```{r}
dose_status <- c("0.5" = "0.5mg/day", "1" = "1.0mg/day", "2" = "2.0mg/day")
```


```{r}
df2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(supp, len, color = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min, ymax = max), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, width = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(vars(dose), labeller = labeller(dose = dose_status)) +
  labs(title = "The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs",
       subtitle = paste0("The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs.","\n", 
                         "Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day)","\n",

       x = "Supplement type", y = "Tooth length", color = "Supplement type") +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
