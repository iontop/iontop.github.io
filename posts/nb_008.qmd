Today I'm gonna make pyramid plot. Typically this plot use comparing two classes at the same time. Maybe you guys saw pyramid plot comparing male and female population by age.  

anyway, there is good blog post what pyramid plot. See the [Kawn's blog](https://www.kwanlin.com/blog/series-visualization/pyramid-plot/) `r emo::ji("+1")`  

## Initializing

I usually use the following code for initialization. If you don't want to remove plots and/or variables, you can skip it.

```{r}
graphics.off()
rm(list = ls())
gc()

```

```{r}
version
```

## Loading Useful Library

We want to use as few packages (some might call them "libraries") as possible. If possible, I'm going to use only the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is one of the most famous packages in R programming, and it's really powerful and useful.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Select Dataset

When I write posts in my blog, I use the built-in dataset because I don't want the reader to suffer by having to find the data from somewhere else.

The dataset I'll be using in this post is shown below `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` `r emo::ji("down_arrow")`.

**The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs** 

Description
The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

Usage   
ToothGrowth  

Format  
A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.

[,1]	len	numeric	Tooth length.  
[,2]	supp	factor	Supplement type (VC or OJ).  
[,3]	dose	numeric	Dose in milligrams/day.

```{r}
ToothGrowth |> head()
```

ToothGrowth dataset is typical dataframe object.   

```{r}
ToothGrowth |> class()
```

and ToothGrowth is 60 rows and 3 columns.    

```{r}
ToothGrowth |> dim()
```

## Visualization

I saved `ToothGrowth` dataset into `df` variable.  

```{r}
df <- ToothGrowth
```

try to make a simple histogram  

```{r}
hist(df$len, main = "Using native hist() function")
```

all right! Now I'd like to make a histogram using `ggplot`.  

Native-R `hist()` function shows 7 bars(= bins), so I define there are 7 bins in histogram.  

I got it as below.  

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(len)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 7, fill = "gray80", color = "black")
```

In `ToothGrowth` dataset, there are 2(two) kind of supplement - Vitamin C or Orange Juice.  

If I need to compare tooth growth by supplement type, I would make a histogram like this.  

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(len)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 7, fill = "gray80", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(vars(supp))
  
```

or...

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(len, fill = supp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 7, position = "dodge")
```

It's too difficult to compare each other. 

Use `coord_flip()` to flip the coordinates, then draw one (vitamin C) facing left and the other (orange juice) facing right.  

The two histograms drawn with their backs to each other produce a pyramid plot.  

The key is that we used `after_stat(count)` to make the values with a certain value (vitamin C) negative.  

:::{.callout-tip}
If you keep 7 bins in plot, there are some blank area. for example, Orange Juice(OJ) has no tooth length over 30.9.   
We don't need compare this kind of data.  
So I'll reduce number of bins 7 to 5.
:::

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(len, fill = supp)) +
  geom_histogram(data = subset(df, supp == "OJ"), bins = 5) +
  geom_histogram(data = subset(df, supp == "VC"), aes(y = after_stat(count)*-1), bins = 5) +
  coord_flip()

```

Now, all most done.

I'll add title and necessary decoration in the plot. 

I finally pyramid plot.  

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(len, fill = supp)) +
  geom_histogram(data = subset(df, supp == "OJ"), bins = 5, fill = "midnightblue", color = "white") +
  geom_histogram(data = subset(df, supp == "VC"), aes(y = after_stat(count)*-1), bins = 5, fill = "darkred", color = "white") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-15, 15), breaks = seq(-15, 15, 5), labels = abs(seq(-15, 15, 5))) +
  labs(title = "The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs",
       subtitle = "The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. \n Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) \n by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C \n and coded as VC).",
       x = "Count", y = "Tooth length", fill = "Supplement type (VC or OJ)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
  
```

Good job! `r emo::ji("+1")`

```{r include=FALSE}
