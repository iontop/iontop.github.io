Today we're going to draw a horizontal stacked bar graph.   

A surprisingly common use of these plots is a single bar graph lying on its side, which I call a **"strip plot"**.  

It's useful when you want to fill in details when drawing a pie plot, or when you want to see approximate proportions and absolute values at once.  

## Initializing

I usually use the following code for initialization. If you don't want to remove plots and/or variables, you can skip it.

```{r}
graphics.off()
rm(list = ls())
gc()

```

```{r}
version
```

## Loading Useful Library

We want to use as few packages (some might call them "libraries") as possible. If possible, I'm going to use only the **tidyverse** package. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is one of the most famous packages in R programming, and it's really powerful and useful.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Select Dataset

When I write posts in my blog, I use the built-in dataset because I don't want the reader to suffer by having to find the data from somewhere else.

The dataset I'll be using in this post is shown below `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` `r emo::ji("down_arrow")`.

**The World's Telephones** 

Description
The number of telephones in various regions of the world (in thousands).  

Usage   
WorldPhones  

Format  
A matrix with 7 rows and 8 columns. The columns of the matrix give the figures for a given region, and the rows the figures for a year.  

The regions are: North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Oceania, Africa, Central America.  

The years are: 1951, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961.    

Source  
AT&T (1961) The World's Telephones.

```{r}
WorldPhones |> head()
```

`WorldPhones` dataset is typical matrix object.   

```{r}
WorldPhones |> class()
```

Let's change to a dataframe to create a strip plot.  

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(WorldPhones)
```

The year is in the row name, but I removed the row name and brought it to the first column for convenient data manipulation in the future.  

```{r}
df <- df |> mutate(year = as.numeric(rownames(df)), .before = "N.Amer")
rownames(df) <- NULL

df

```

```{r}
class(df)
```

```{r}
dim(df)
```

## Visualization

`WorldPhones` is a matrix, so you can easily draw a dot plot using the built-in function as shown below.  

Actually, it's not bad. `r emo::ji("thinking")`   

```{r}
barplot(t(WorldPhones)[,7])
title(main = "World phones data in 1961")
```

However, it would be more intuitive to represent the number of phones in each country on a single line with a length proportional to the number.  
Drawing such a stacked bar chart is not easy with the built-in `barplot()` function.  

There are several ways to draw a single stacked bar plot (a.k.a. strip plot), but it is more convenient to use the geom_col() function than to use the geom_bar() function. 


::: {.callout-tip}
In this case, a tip is to leave the x-axis blank `aes(x = "")` for the aesthetic.  
:::

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(year == "1961") |> 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "region", values_to = "num_tele") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = "",y = num_tele, fill = region)) +
  geom_col()

```

We're almost there. Now you can reorient the plot, reduce its width, and fill it with a colour of your choice to create a strip plot.  

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(year == "1961") |> 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "region", values_to = "num_tele") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = "",y = reorder(num_tele, num_tele), fill = region)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  coord_flip()
```

I added labels to make it easier to see the number of phones and rotated the labels to make them easier to read. 

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(year == "1961") |> 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "region", values_to = "num_tele") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = "",y = reorder(num_tele, num_tele), fill = region)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = num_tele), angle = -90,
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  coord_flip()
```

The last step is to add a title and a few more embellishments to finish it off.

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(year == "1961") |> 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "region", values_to = "num_tele") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = "",y = reorder(num_tele, num_tele), fill = region)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(region,"\n",num_tele)), angle = -90,
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "The World's Telephones at 1961",
       subtitle = "The number of telephones in various regions of the world (in thousands).",
       fill = "Region") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(80,10,50,10), legend.position = "bottom")
```

Good job! `r emo::ji("+1")`

```{r include=FALSE}
ggsave("image.png")
```
